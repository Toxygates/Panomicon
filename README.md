## Overview

Toxygates is a web application for user-friendly analysis of multi-omics data (presently focusing on mRNA and mRNA-miRNA interaction data). It was originally developed for Open TG-GATEs dataset but is now being used for more general purposes.

The latest public version is available at http://toxygates.nibiohn.go.jp .

The main technologies used in this project are Java (frontend and backend), Scala (backend) and GWT (Google Web Toolkit). Numerical data is stored in Kyoto Cabinet; other kinds of data are stored as RDF (we currently use Fuseki).

The contents of this directory are:

OTGTool/ 
Back-end and command line tools

Toxygates/
GWT-based web frontend

Further build and deploy instructions will be published here in the near future.
