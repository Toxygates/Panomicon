<h3>Toxygates version history</h3>

<h4>20170523</h4>

<ul>
<li>
A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01500-1">new paper</a> on Toxygates has been published in Scientific Reports. The supplementary information
contains a <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-01500-1/MediaObjects/41598_2017_1500_MOESM2_ESM.pdf">detailed step-by-step guide</a>, which may be helpful.

<li>
More comprehensive integration with InterMine-based data warehouses. Toxygates is now integrated with 
HumanMine, RatMine and MouseMine in addition to TargetMine, and can export, import and enrich gene sets with all of these.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>20170302</h4>
Minor updates and enhancements, including:

<ul>
<li>Clusters and normal gene sets can now both be synchronised with TargetMine automatically.</li>
<li>Compound ranking can be done based on both clusters and normal gene sets.</li>
<li>A convenient "Set all" button makes compound ranking easier to work with when many rules are specified.</li>
</ul>

<h4>20161020 ("v2.0")</h4>
Several major new features have now been released, including:

<ul>
<li>A clustering and heat-map visualisation feature has been added.</li>
<li>Users may now upload their own data and analyse it alongside existing data in Toxygates.</li>
<li>KEGG pathways and GO terms are now updated automatically on a weekly basis.</li>
</ul>

With the addition of user data uploads and clustering/visualisation, Toxygates is now a much
more powerful analysis environment than previously.
 
<H4>20160313</H4>
Many improvements and new features, including:
<ul>
<li>Compound ranking is now on a separate screen, independent of group definitions.</li>
<li>Gene sets can now be managed more easily via a dedicated menu.</li>
<li>Larger, downloadable charts.</li>
<li>Gene set enrichment (via TargetMine)</li>
<li>Four different kinds of column filters, and visual indication when a column filter is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<H4>20150928</H4>
Major changes have been made to the underlying framework. Most of these changes should not
be visible to users. However, the following major user-facing changes have taken place:

<ul>
<li> The six data sets on the start screen have been replaced by a more general 
sample class selector on the group definition screen (upper left corner).</li>
<li> We changed the way that averages of samples are calculated when fold changes are displayed: 
instead of the mean of log-2 ratios, we now use the log-2 of the mean.</li>
<li> The probe selection screen has been removed and replaced by a probe set editor,
which is a pop-up window on the data screen. This makes it easier to interactively 
change the current probe set. </li>
<li> CSV files can be downloaded both as grouped (average) and as individual samples. </li>
<li> Data loading is faster, especially for a small probe set. </li>
</ul>

<H4>20140612</H4>
Fixed a bug that prevented probes from being selected (for example by pathway) in some cases.
Changed the popup charts to select time/dose intelligently based on user-defined groups.
Fixed a bug in TargetMine gene list import.
Added an information message about the number of genes for the current species that 
were successfully imported from TargetMine.

<H4>20140410</H4>
This version has the following major improvements:
<ul>
<li><b>A feedback system is available.</b> We urge you to send us comments or questions. Please see the help menu above.</li>
<li>The menu structure has been reorganised.</li>
<li>Gene and compound lists can be named and saved.</li>
<li>Compound lists can be used to control compound ranking.</li>
<li>TargetMine export/import of gene lists has been strengthened. 
This feature now synchronises with a TargetMine user account.</li>
<li>The global value filter has been replaced by individual filtering for columns.</li>
<li>Control samples can now to be charted (in the case of normalized intensity values).</li>
<li>The auto-generated names for sample groups are now more helpful.</li>
<li>A layout issue on the probe selection screen that caused the UI to not resize properly 
when the window was resized was fixed.</li>
<li>An information popup that describes the samples for a given checkbox was added to the group definition screen.</li>
<li>Present/absent samples are indicated in tooltips and in charts.</li>
<li>Data loading is faster.</li>
</ul>

<H4>20131205</H4>
Added a new compound selection method that allows for typing or pasting compound names,
as well as autocompleted compound search. Changed gene autocompletion to be based on
gene symbols rather than names.
Added checkboxes to select all samples from a particular dose and time 
combination simultaneously.

<h4>20131114</h4>
Improved performance of ChEMBL target lookups.
Changed the default sort order for data columns to descending.

<h4>20131104</h4>
Switched to the official ChEMBL SPARQL endpoint that is now provided by EBI.
Addressed some minor bugs that could make the application unresponsive.

<h4>20131020</h4>
Addressed some problems in compound ranking.

<h4>20131013</h4>
Ensured that only time/dose combinations that are available
as actual samples can be selected. Adjusted the positions of popup windows.

<h4>20130917 (approximately)</h4>
First official release.
