<H3>Probe selection</H3>

The probe selection screen allows you to select the microarray probes (corresponding to mRNA, and indirectly genes and proteins) that you want 
to display in the main data table, which follows immediately after probe selection has finished. Groups, which were defined in the previous step, 
will be displayed as columns, and probes will be displayed as rows.
	If you do not want to select any particular probes, you can proceed to the next screen without making a selection. This is done by clicking
	 <i>Display data with all probes</i>
	 at the bottom of the screen. In this case, all probes will be displayed. This is approximately 30,000 probes for rat cells, and 50,000
	  probes for human cells.
	If you want to select a particular set of probes, several different methods can be used. You can use multiple sources simultaneously to 
	select probes. At this time of writing the following probe sources are supported.

<H4>KEGG pathways</H4>

KEGG pathway data is loaded in realtime from the Bio2RDF project. This data is currently hosted in Canada and while generally reliable, 
it may occasionally be unavailable. In order to obtain the probes associated with a pathway, first type the name of the pathway. 
A partial name is acceptable. Then press enter to search. You will see a list of matching pathways. Select the pathway you are
 interested in, and wait for a few seconds. If there are matching probes available for this data set, the <i>Add selected probes
  </i> button should become clickable. Click it, and the corresponding probes are added to the list on the right.
	If you want, you can add probes from multiple pathways in this way. When you are satisfied with your selected probes list, 
	you can click <i>Display data</i> with selected probes at the bottom of the screen to proceed to the next stage.

<H4>GO term search</H4>
The GO term based probe search is very similar to the KEGG pathway search. However, the data is hosted locally, and should thus 
always be available as long as Toxygates itself is available. For both KEGG pathways and GO terms, note that the initial search
 is sensitive to the name only. Thus, if you search for “cancer”  you will not find the KEGG pathway called “basal cell carcinoma”.

<H4<CHEMBL targets</H4>
This feature lets you search for CHEMBL targets for a selected compound. Only the compounds that are part of your active groups
 (from the previous screen) will be shown here. Select a compound and click <i>Add CHEMBL targets</i> to add the relevant probes to the list
  on the right hand side. Probes whose protein have an IC50 score for the given compound will be added (the actual IC50 value is ignored). 
  As the CHEMBL data is hosted remotely, it may occasionally be unavailable. Also, note that many more CHEMBL targets are available for
   human proteins than for rat proteins.

<H4>DrugBank targets</H4>
This feature is very similar to the CHEMBL target search, but DrugBank target information is used instead. This data is also stored remotely.

<H4>Free selection</H4>
Here, you can specify probes explicitly by entering the names of genes, probes or proteins. One identifier per line is accepted. 
Note that a particular gene or protein may have multiple corresponding probes (and a probe may have multiple corresponding genes or proteins).
In this case, all the relevant probes will be added.

<H4>Next step</H4>
When you are happy with the list of selected probes, click <i>Display data with chosen probes</i> to proceed. If you do not want to choose any 
particular probes, click <i>Display data with all probes</i>.
