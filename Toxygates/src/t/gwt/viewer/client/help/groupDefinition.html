<br><H3>Sample group definition screen</H3>
The first step to viewing and analysing data is to define one or several columns. That can be done on this screen.
Once you have defined columns, you can proceed to view data.
 
In addition, as a secondary function, this screen allows you to rank compounds by behaviour with respect to a 
set of genes.

<H4>Defining groups</H4>
Groups contain some number of samples. A sample is a set of expression values from an individual, for a particular point in time, for a
 particular set of conditions. Samples are added to a group by selecting dose levels and measurement times for some compound. In general,
  expression values for three separate samples are available for each dose and time combination (though not always).
	The main use of groups is to organise the data that is being displayed. In the data screen, later on in the workflow, groups will
	 correspond to columns. Each column will contain the average expression values of all samples in that group.


<H4>Selecting a sample class</H4>
First, select the species, tissue and test type, and so on, that you are interested in. For example, in the top left
corner of the screen, you may select parameters such as "Rat/in vivo/Liver/Single". When you change these parameters,
you can see the compounds that are available for this <i>sample class</i>. Single and repeat refer to single and repeated
dosage of a compound, respectively.

<H4>Defining a group</H4>
In order to create a new group, it is necessary to select the compounds that are to be in the group. This is done by using the 
list on the left hand side. It may be necessary to scroll down to find the compounds you are looking for. Toggle the check box next 
to a compound to select it.
	Once some number of compounds have been selected, time/dose checkboxes will show up on the right hand side of the screen for the
	 selected compounds. Here, you can toggle those combinations you want to include in the group. If you do not select at least one 
	 combination, the chosen compound will not be part of the group. 
	When you have selected the combinations that interest you, you can enter a memorable  name for the group. Click Save to save the
	 group. It will be remembered by the web browser, so that the next time you use Toxygates, the group will remain. The data is 
	 stored
in
the
“local storage” facility. Note that groups can be active or inactive. By default, groups are active when they are 
	 created. Inactive groups are still remembered by the web browser, but they will not appear later on in the data analysis. This 
	 can be a useful way to retain groups that you want to use in the future but do not want to work with at the moment.

<H4>Modifying a group</H4>
In order to modify a group, first select it in the	 list of existing groups. You can now change the compounds and time/dose combinations 
that are part of it. Click Save again to save it. If you change the name before saving it, a new group will be created and the old one
will remain as it was.

<H4>Deleting a group</H4>
In order to delete a group, select it in the list of existing groups and click Delete.

<H4>Next step</H4>
When you have finished defining groups (at least one must be defined and activated), click the Next: View data button at the bottom 
of the screen to proceed.
