Toxygates is an integrated platform for toxicogenomics data analysis. 
For more information, please see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/23/3080">our <i>Bioinformatics</i> paper</a>, or use the help menu.
<p>

On 28 September 2015, a new major version of Toxygates was released.
Instead of selecting a "dataset" such as rat/in vivo/liver/single on this start page, 
you can now configure these parameters directly on the following screen (Sample group definitions).
<p>
We have also changed the way that averages of samples are calculated when fold changes are displayed: 
instead of the mean of log-2 ratios, we now use the log-2 of the mean.
<p>
There are also other minor changes to the user interface. Please feel free to contact us if 
you have any questions or concerns (see the Help/Feedback menu above)).
