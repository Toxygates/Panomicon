<ul>
<li>Further UI improvements.</li>
<li>Samples now have an associated type (mRNA). This is a preparatory step towards future 
simultaneous analysis of multiple types of 'omics data.</li>
<li>On the "My data" screen, the metadata of samples can now be updated quickly without deleting and re-inserting the
batch, and several data uploading bugs were fixed.</li>
</ul>

Because of a new storage format, if you have any problems displaying charts, 
please try deleting your sample groups and recreating them again.
