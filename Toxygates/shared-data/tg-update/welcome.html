Toxygates is an integrated platform for toxicogenomics data analysis. 
For more information, please see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/23/3080">our <i>Bioinformatics</i> paper</a>, or use the help menu.

<h3>2016-10-20 ("v2.0")</h3>
Several major new features have now been released.

<ul>
<li>A clustering and heat-map visualisation feature has been added.</li>
<li>Users may now upload their own data and analyse it alongside existing data in Toxygates.</li>
<li>KEGG pathways and GO terms are now updated automatically on a weekly basis.</li>
</ul>

With the addition of user data uploads and clustering/visualisation, Toxygates is now a much
more powerful analysis environment than previously, and we urge users to try these functions for themselves.
<p>
Unfortunately, the user guide and the help system are currently out of date. Updated versions that describe the 
new features are in progress.
