<H3>View data</H3>

This screen shows actual data values based on the probes selected and columns defined in the previous two screens. 
Depending on how big the columns are, the data may take some time to load. When the data has been loaded, by default,
 3 + n columns will be displayed, where the final n columns are the groups that you have defined. Each row will correspond to a probe. 
 The numbers shown represent the average for a given probe in each group. You can carry out several actions to inspect the data on this screen.

<H4>Page navigation</H4> Use the arrows in the upper left corner to navigate between the pages. 20 probes per page are displayed.
 The fast jump button lets you jump 10 pages at a time.
  
<H4>Magnitude filtering</H4> By entering a number and clicking <i>Apply</i>, you can filter the probes so that only the ones that contain a
 value whose absolute value is greater than this number will be shown. Note that if you are viewing fold values, the absolute value <nobr>| log2 (xc/x) |</nobr> will be used. If you are viewing absolute values, <nobr>| x |</nobr> will be used. Click No filter to reset the display.
 
<H4>T-Test and U-Test</H4>First, click on <i>Analysis</i> to display the testing controls. By selecting two different groups and clicking the <i>Add T-Test</i> button, it is possible to add a special column with 
p-values for the Studentâ€™s T-Test. The Add U-Test button is similar, except that it adds a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-Test. The <i>Remove Tests</i> button removes all test columns generated in this way.
 
<H4>Sort data</H4> By clicking the column header of either a group column or a test column, it is possible to sort the data either in an ascending or 
a descending manner. A small triangle will show the sorting that is currently in effect. It is not possible to sort by non-numerical columns.

<H4>Display extra columns</H4> On the columns menu, you will find many extra columns that can be displayed. For example, the KEGG pathways or the
 GO terms of each probe can be shown. These columns are fetched dynamically, and thus the data may take a little while to display in some cases. 
 Select a menu item here to make a column visible if it is currently invisible, and again to make a column invisible if it is currently visible.
 
<H4>Download CSV file</H4> On the <i>actions</i> menu you will find this menu item. It allows you to download all the currently shown data as a CSV file. 
All data is downloaded, even data that on pages not currently shown on the screen. Dynamically fetched columns, such as GO term or KEGG pathway columns, are not included in the CSV file. Test columns are included.
<H4>Display charts</H4> By clicking the chart icon on a row, it is possible to display charts that show the expression pattern for the corresponding probe. Two kinds of charts are available: <i>Individual values</i> and <i>All time series</i>.

<H4>Export to TargetMine</H4>On the <i>actions</i> menu, you will find this menu item. It allows you to export the genes corresponding to the currently 
displayed data to the TargetMine system, based on a pre-selected TargetMine template. (You can use other templates once the list is
transferred to TargetMine). You can not export more than 500 genes. If you try to export more than 500, only the first 500, in the order
that you have sorted them, will be exported.
